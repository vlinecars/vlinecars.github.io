The remaining Z type carriages were temporarily removed from service in January 2013 due to cracking occurring in the bogies.

V/Line to remove Z carriages for inspection
Added: 30 January 2013

Public Transport Victoria said today that V/Line had decided to immediately remove 22 of its older carriages from the V/Line fleet for testing and repairs.

V/Line decided to remove the carriages from service following a safety audit which revealed fatigue cracks in some critical areas of the ‘bogies’ or undercarriages of ‘Z’ class carriages.

PTV CEO and Chair Ian Dobbs said: “V/line has advised that safety and maintenance inspections have raised concerns about the condition of the bogies that support the Z carriages. As a result, V/Line has announced that the carriages will be withdrawn from service for further testing and repairs starting immediately.

“We support V/Line’s decision to withdraw the carriages for testing and, where necessary, to address any critical issues with the bogies.

“Our priority is to ensure that V/Line continues to run a safe network.

“Once thorough testing has been completed on each bogie, V/Line will be in a better position to determine the next steps and decide when the carriages can be returned to service. Experience would indicate that this may take some months to achieve.”

Mr Dobbs said that PTV and V/Line were working to organise replacement coach services to minimise the extent of any disruption.

Shepparton, Warrnambool, Swan Hill, Bairnsdale, and some Geelong and Traralgon trains will have fewer seats while this essential work is carried out, so additional coaches will be made available to accommodate the reduced capacity on these services.

Importantly, none of the carriages operates on peak commuter services. V/Line trains have a total of 70,000 seats each weekday and the withdrawal of these carriages involves about ten per cent of seats, not all of which are occupied on these off peak services. In most cases, these trains will operate with four carriages instead of five.

V/Line Acting CEO Ross Pedley said: “With safety as our number one priority in the operation of Victoria’s regional train service, V/Line is withdrawing these carriages to allow for a thorough examination by our fleet experts.”

“While the reduction in capacity will cause some inconvenience we want to ensure that there is no risk to the safety of our passengers and staff. We will ensure that passenger services are maintained, supplemented by road coaches where needed.”

“V/Line apologises for any inconvenience caused to our customers while we undergo this safety check, but I am sure that everyone shares our view that safety is paramount.”

was told that of the Z carriages, only 9 are out of service now and all are expected to be back in service by the end of the year.




Aug 2016



As of today. There are 11 Z cars still out on repairs.

During 2014 a number were returned to service. Now these cars are also due for rewheel.

From what I understand the frame crack issues have surfaced again. 

Some of the Z cars still haven't turned a wheel since the original issue started with the complete withdrawal of the cars. They have sat in Newport in the same spot since 2012?

In late January 2013 V/Line decided to remove 22 carriages
from service following a safety audit which revealed fatigue
cracks in some critical areas of the ‘bogies’ or undercarriages
of Z class carriages. While the ultimate solution is to replace
the bogies, this will take time as these are large castings
which must be produced by specialist foundries. In the
interim, the Fleet team is addressing this issue by working
with experts in the field of fatigue analysis to determine
and implement extensive defect detection and monitoring
process which will allow the return of some of these bogies
prior to the arrival of the new bogies.
The withdrawal of these carriages accounted for less
than 10 per cent of seats, with most of the affected trains
operating with four carriages instead of five. However,
this did make some trains inaccessible to customers in
wheelchairs, so V/Line provided alternative transport in
the form of accessible taxis. Coaches were also used to
supplement trains in cases of crowding. These plans will
continue until all the carriages re-join the fleet.
The carriages will progressively return to service over the
next two years – the first returned in June 2013 and was
rostered to the busiest lines and services

Maintenance on rolling stock (Z cars) and various other
faults is not being attended to. Z carriage’s fleet has now
seen reduced operations due to cracked bogies for
nearly a year. 12 carriages remain out of service.
