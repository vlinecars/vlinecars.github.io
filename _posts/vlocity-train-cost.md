$125 MILLION RAIL MANUFACTURING BOOST TO PROVIDE NINE NEW TRAINS FOR REGIONAL RAIL LINES

The Bracks Government today announced a massive rail manufacturing boost for Victoria, with a new $125 million contract to build an extra nine trains for the regional rail network.

Transport Minister Peter Batchelor said the Government had exercised an option in the existing Bombardier contract – which provided for 29 trains at a cost of $410 million - to secure an additional nine new trains for operation on regional rail lines. 




 
I did the sums a few years ago:

National Express - 29 dual car Vlocity trains for VLP - commenced 2002.
Cost: $215 million/total - $7.41 million/set - $3.70 million/car.
Dept of Infrastructure - 9 regional trains - commenced Nov 2003.
Cost: $125 million/total - $13.88 million/set - $6.94 million / car

The DoI spent $46.6 million to upgrade the maximum speed of the initial 29 Vlocities ordered by NX from 145 km/h to 160 km/h. This means the cost per unit of the original VLocity order was $5 million/set - almost $2 million less a set than the later 9 car extension order.
