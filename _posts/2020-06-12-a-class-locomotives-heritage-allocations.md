In June 2020 two retired V/Line A class locomotives were allocated to Victorian rail heritage groups for preservation - A60 to the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre and A62 to 707 Operations. 

The locomotives had been retired in 2016 and placed in long term storage at South Dynon, stripped of parts and drained of fluids.

On Friday 5 June the locomotives were shunted into the appropriate order for their transfer to their new owners.

On Saturday 6 June the heritage groups came to South Dynon to collect their new toys, each bringing a collection of carriages along for the purposes of braking the unbraked A class locomotives.
