On Monday, 24th September 2018 the first Public Transport Victoria liveried Sprinter railcar entered revenue service. As well as bearing the new livery, Sprinter 7012 also featured a modified interior layout.

The luggage cage at the toilet end of the railcar was replaced by a wheelchair area and VLocity-style flip down seats.

While the rows of seats on the other side were replaced by a VLocity-style luggage rack and more flip down seats.

The rest of the saloon seating was left unchanged.

The exterior destination board was upgraded, with the original 'flipdot' screen replaced by a brighter LED array.

**Footnote**

Some people have described the front of the new PTV livery as a 'smile', but is it just an attempt to shoehorn the curved VLocity livery design onto a flat front?
