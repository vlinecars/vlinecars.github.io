10 carriages and a power van are behind A62 on the transfer to Bacchus Marsh
The leading 6-car set was VSH22 with a car added, the trailing 4-car set was VSH25 minus two carriages and an extra one added. Two SH sets were returned to Melbourne the day before, the reshuffle is supposed to be linked to the remarshalling some H cars into 6-car sets with upgraded HEP wiring.
