The N class country passenger carriage project was completed during the year. There are now 57 of these modern air-conditioned carriages in service operating as 19 3-car sets.

Refurbishing of other air-conditioned steel carriages continued with seven BRS catering vehicles and six S/Z seating carriages being remodelled.

A separate rebuilding program involving 39 former Harris suburban carriages was well advanced; 24 were delivered during the year and at 30 June were about to enter service on the Kyneton and Seymour interurban runs. Four carriages were hired from Australian National. Resulting from the above deliveries a further 36 wooden-bodied passenger vehicles were able to be scrapped during the year, leaving a total of 57 still in opera- tion.

Design work on proposed next generation intercity carriages continued throughout the year. A decision as to the commencement of manufacture of these vehicles is still under consideration. Additional passenger vehicles or a change in mode of operation of some services are required before all wooden-bodied carriages can be withdrawn without affect- ing current service levels.

The first three of 13 T class diesel locomotives, to be rebuilt and designated P class to haul the refurbished Harris suburban carriages, entered service.

Five of the fleet of 26 B class diesel locomotives were also rebuilt, upgraded and returned to service as A class. A decision as to whether the present contract to similarly upgrade all 26 B class locomotives or instead substitute new locomotives is presently under consideration.

Contracts were let for 25 new passenger and freight locomotives, with delivery to begin during 1984/85. This will allow a start to be made on the withdrawal of older locomotives, many of which are no longer suitable for heavy duty freight train operations.
