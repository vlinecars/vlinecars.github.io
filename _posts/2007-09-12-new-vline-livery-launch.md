<p>On Wednesday 12<sup>th</sup> September 2007, V/Line unveiled their new colour scheme and a refitted H set and Sprinter railcar at a ministerial and media launch held at Southern Cross Station.</p>
<p>Attended by invited V/Line, Department of Infrastructure and EDI Rail, along with invited guests and the Minister for Public Transport, Ms. Lynne Kosky, the launch proceedings took place between 11:30 and 12:00.</p>
<p>Staff and guests were invited to walk through and look at the refurbished interiors of both sprinter 7007 and four car H set FSH25.</p>
<p>Prior to the launch, 7007 and FSH25 were transferred to Southern Cross ex Newport Workshops:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>N452+FSH25 arrived into Platform 4 North at 10:41. Following arrival, N452 cut off and ran to EDI Rail&rsquo;s West Melbourne Depot, whilst N453 arrived and coupled up to the east end of FSH25, before pushing the set to the buffers of Platform 4 Central.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7007+7008 arrived into Platform 3 Central at 11:13, with 7008 uncoupling from 7007 at 11:18 and running to the railcar depot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> Unlike previous launches and unveilings, no speeches were given; however, Ms. Kosky spoke to WIN News who had exclusive rights to the launch.<br /><br /> Platforms 3 and 4 were closed during the time of the launch, with the general public unable to access them &ndash; the Collins Street and Bourke Street bridge entrances being guarded.</p>
<p>Following the launch, 7007 departed for EDI Rail&rsquo;s West Melbourne Depot at 12:33, and a special train consisting of N453+FSH25 for invited V/Line staff and guests ran to Sunbury and back. Times for this special are listed below:-</p>
