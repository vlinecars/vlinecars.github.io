VL75, the last of the current order for VLocitys, has
been delivered. The next order, for four trains, VL76
-79, will has some differences. The most significant
of these is:
DM car toilet won't be fitted. Instead, they will
gain two seats in its place.
Other items: CCTV to saloon and forward facing
out the cab windscreen.
Altered sanding arrangement to include the TM
car, similar in set up to VL38, although it will
sand either side of the TM power bogie.
Equipment locker to house CCTV and space for
High capacity signalling (HCS) equipment.
Emissions to Euro II standard (particulate filter
added to muffler).
 Lowering of traction engine output to 650 hp.
(For fuel economy)
Widening of the saloon doors at the DMD and
TM ends, to comply with disabled access.
Train crew steps reinstalled at the TM car doors.
Altered seating layout and new style seats.


VL 80-88 is again a separate order and again more
differences, more significant than previously:
 Modified cab frame structure to increase
crash-worthiness
HCS equipment installed and set up for trial.
Cab layout believed to change to incorporate
ergonomic requirements and changes to cab
structure and equipment.
Altered seating layout to accommodate more
standing passengers.
Toilet reinstated in the DM car.
