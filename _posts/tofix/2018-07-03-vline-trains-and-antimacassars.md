The word for today is '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimacassar" rel="noopener" target="_blank">antimacassar</a>' - a piece of cloth placed on the back of a chair to protect the seat fabric from dirt. A decade ago they were a common sight onboard V/Line trains.

They were fitted to the seats onboard the Sprinter trains.

As well as the newest VLocity trains.

As you might expect, antimacassars on a V/Line train would get dirty quite quickly, as well as being a target for vandalism.

Good thing they came in boxes of 2000!

But by 2008 they disappeared from VLocity trains used on commuter services.

And by April 2009 they had started to disappear from the locomotive hauled carriages used on long distance services.

The <a href="https://www.railpage.com.au/f-t11348883.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">word at the time</a> was that the manufacturer went bust, and V/Line couldn't find a new supplier. 

In the years since nothing has changed - V/Line seats are still bare, the layers of head grease increasing day by day.

<strong>Footnote</strong>

V/Line antimacassar supplier was Merino Pty Ltd in Queensland, <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/business/staff-soak-up-merino-pain/news-story/02ce8355f7fcf33b763b933368a238ca?sv=5cc121cbe56002f4b55fb94058d728c7&nk=85a6e6c50784ab89bbf050476b16c3fa-1528429017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which entered administration in 2007</a>.

<blockquote>February 25, 2008

A failed punt on recycled paper and a million-dollar-plus water compliance bill helped quicken the collapse of Australia's oldest tissue manufacturer.

More than 100 staff at Logan City-based Merino were made redundant earlier this month as the bulk of the business and its assets were sold to a Victorian rival for $29.4 million.

Merino, whose brands include SAFE, Bouquets and Earthwise toilet paper, had lost more than $21 million since 2005 before entering voluntary administration last December.</blockquote>
