Back in April 2014 Public Transport Victoria released a draft of an <a href="http://www.danielbowen.com/2014/04/16/new-train-map-coming/" target="_blank">easier to read train map for Melbourne</a>, and not a minute too soon - the current version implies non-existent options routes such as a Sunbury to Upfield line. So what about the V/Line network map?

<a href="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ptv-confusing-vline-map-full.png"><img src="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ptv-confusing-vline-map-full.png" alt="Confusing V/Line network map" width="500" height="731" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5160" /></a>

It suffers from one major defect - the same "phantom through running" problem that afflicts the current suburban rail map. Here is a closer look at the troublesome section:

<a href="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ptv-confusing-vline-map-original.png"><img src="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ptv-confusing-vline-map-original.png" alt="Confusing V/Line network map - original version" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5157" /></a>

'Melbourne (Southern Cross)' is displayed in larger text, which implies it is the center of the network, but what is going on elsewhere. Can I take a train from Geelong to Seymour?  How about Bacchus Marsh to Nar Nar Goon? Or Clarkefield to Wandong?

An additional complication is the station stop at North Melbourne - since December 2013 trains from Geelong no longer stop there, because the <a href="http://wongm.com/2014/11/regional-rail-link-north-melbourne-platforms/" target="_blank">new RRL tracks through the station lack platforms</a>. As a result, V/Line jiggled their network map to show that trains from Geelong no longer stop there.

<a href="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ptv-confusing-vline-map-geelong-rrl-bypass.png"><img src="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ptv-confusing-vline-map-geelong-rrl-bypass.png" alt="Confusing V/Line network map - Geelong line following initial RRL opening" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5156" /></a>

However even that map is out of date - in July 2014 Ballarat and Bendigo trains were also moved onto the Regional Rail Link tracks, but the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140713135642/http://www.vline.com.au/pdf/networkmaps/vline_myki_map.pdf" target="_blank">network map was not updated</a>.

<strong>An update</strong>

Down in the comments Alan pointed out that V/Line <em>did</em> update their network map following the removal of the North Melbourne stop for Ballarat and Bendigo line passengers.

<a href="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/vline-network-map-2014-finally-updated.png"><img src="http://wongm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/vline-network-map-2014-finally-updated-500x333.png" alt="V/Line network map updated for Ballarat and Bendigo services not stopping at North Melbourne" width="500" height="333" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5564" /></a>

I even use the same network map in the lead image of this post - I didn't notice the subtle redesign that moved Southern Cross to the middle of the map, and North Melbourne station to the Seymour leg. Oops!

<strong>Footnote</strong>

V/Line also has a network map that also include their road coach services - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140712190418/http://www.vline.com.au/pdf/networkmaps/simplemap.pdf" target="_blank">the insert focused on Melbourne</a> is a little better designed, showing the North Melbourne stop correctly, and avoiding any implications of non-existent through running.
