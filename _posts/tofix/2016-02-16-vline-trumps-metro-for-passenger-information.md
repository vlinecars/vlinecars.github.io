I visited Wyndham Vale station recently, and was pleasantly surprised by the amount of next train information made available to passengers.

On arriving in the waiting room I found a summary board listing the next three departures in each direction.

When walking along the footbridge towards the platforms, each platform had the next three departures listed, including stopping patterns.

While down on the platform, the stopping pattern of the next train was again displayed, as well as the following three trains.

Now compare Wyndham Vale with your average station on the "suburban" network - lucky stations get a single LED matrix display per platform that displays the time until the next train, with the stopping pattern scrolling along the bottom line.

While everybody else gets stuck with the <a href="http://wongm.com/2014/05/metro-trains-passenger-information-displays/" target="_blank">hopeless "talking bricks"</a>.

V/Line might be in denial about their status as a suburban rail operator, but whoever specified their new real time train information system knew what they were doing.

<strong>Footnote</strong>

On second thoughts, the main reason that V/Line's new passenger information screens are "good" is because the systems in suburban Melbourne are so woefully inadequate. Over at V/Line the hardware itself looks fine, as is the information provided to passengers, but the layout and display of the data could be much improved - larger fonts and the use of colour would make a world of difference.
