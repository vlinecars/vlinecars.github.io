<div class="imported">This is an post from the olden days - <a href="http://wongm.com/2013/01/old-msn-posts-imported">read more about them here</a>.</div>Friday the 3rd was the first day of VLocites on the Geelong line.

The train pulled in to Geelong at 11:30, only taking 50 minutes to travel from Melbourne. And this wasn't at full speed either.

However, there were only a dozen passengers on board. All government officials.

The Victorian Premier Steve Bracks and Transport minister Peter Batchelor arrived at12:40 for the launch ceremony, along with a lot of other local politicians. There was a lot of newspaper photographers and TV cameramen there as well. The next 20 minutes was taken up by speeches.

The train took off at 1:30, but Steve Bracks never caught it. He just watched it depart from Geelong, while Peter Batchelor was on board, but bailed out at Lara. To go by road I assume...

I stayed on all the way to Melbourne. And grabbed a goody bag. Or half-dozen...

And now I have a lot of V/Line pens. And rail yard full of cardboard trains...
