<p>I was at Spencer Street Station today and saw this rather strange sign hidden away. It was well made, and designed to be used many times.</p>
<p>It said the following:<em>&quot;Due to industrial action the country and interstate train service has been substituted by road coaches. Passengers for trains on lines listed here under, are to please proceed to departure points listed below.&quot;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-bits/152_5270.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-bits/152_5270_595.jpg?cached=1405921518" alt="You know you have industrial problems when you have a nice sign made up ready for when the train crews go on strike" /></a></p>

<p>I as one question <u>why were there so many strikes</u> that a permanent sign was needed?
