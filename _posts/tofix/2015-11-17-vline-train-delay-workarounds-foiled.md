Last week passengers on a Geelong-bound V/Line service were stuck at Deer Park for almost 3Â½ hours <a href="http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/news/geelong/geelong-vline-train-delays-cause-chaos-for-morning-commuters/news-story/2ef54a4f8ed9c0e65314a49fa6777733" target="_blank">after their train broke down</a>, with many other Geelong services also being delayed. So how does one broken down train manage to cause so many issues?

V/Line said the delays were due to a "obstruction on the track".

The "obstruction" being a broken down train!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/katja_ghost">@katja_ghost</a> Yes it is a broken down train. We have sent a rescue train to clear the line. The Geelong line should have movement shortly.</p>&mdash; V/Line Geelong Line  (@vline_geelong) <a href="https://twitter.com/vline_geelong/status/664559938966913024">November 11, 2015</a></blockquote>

With one track through Deer Park blocked, V/Line should have had multiple option for working around it - but were foiled at every turn.

Firstly, trains to Geelong could have been sent along the 'old' route via Werribee - I wrote about <a href="http://wongm.com/2015/08/alternate-vline-rail-routes-victoria/" target="_blank">V/Line's alternate routes</a> the other month. 

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-melbourne/F111_4215.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-melbourne/F111_4215_500.jpg" alt="N455 leads the down Warrnambool service past the end of the overhead wires at Werribee" /></a>

However things are never easy, and in the case of the Geelong line, Metro Trains Melbourne has decided to make things difficult - in October 2015 they banned V/Line's fleet of VLocity and Sprinter trains from the line beyond Werribee, due to issues with said trains activating the now-seldom used level crossings. So there goes that option!

Another way to keep on running trains is the use of bidirectional signalling, which safely allows trains in either direction to use any track.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-bacchus-marsh/D708_0850.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-bacchus-marsh/D708_0850_500.jpg" alt="Signals and darkened skies at Deer Park" /></a>

The railway between Sunshine and Deer Park West once formed part of the main route between Melbourne and Adelaide, so a second track was laid in the 1970s, so that faster moving passenger trains could overtake the far heavier and slower freight trains.

In the years since, trains to Adelaide were been diverted onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_standard_gauge_line" target="_blank">new route via Geelong</a> and the Regional Fast Rail project increased the speed of passenger trains, but the bidirectional signalling was kept in place, allowing movements like this pair of Ballarat trains chasing each other into Melbourne on separate tracks.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-bacchus-marsh/E117_2397.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-bacchus-marsh/E117_2397_500.jpg" alt="3VL47 and classmate head towards Sunshine, with another VLocity closing in behind along the parallel track" /></a>

However as part of the Regional Rail Link project it was decided that bidirectional signalling was "too complicated" and the system was ripped out, leaving one track for citybound trains and the other for outbound trains.

So in the end, V/Line gets stuck with a broken down train blocking their tracks at Deer Park, an alternate route they are not allowed to use, and a clear track that they were not able to run trains along. Progress, eh?

<strong>Footnote</strong>

While bidirectional signalling provides a great deal of flexibility in the operation of trains, it isn't necessarily the most efficient way to operate a railway - switching between tracks causes conflicts, and hence cuts down the available track capacity.

The real benefit comes during disruptions - instead of cancelling services altogether, you can still run a limited rail service past the blockage, albeit with some delays as trains in opposing directions take their turn to traverse the section of single track.

The best example of this is the double track from Newport through to North Geelong via Werribee - it still retains a bidirectional signalling system, but is normally operated in the standard 'left hand running' mode to maximise the number of trains using the line. However during trackwork or disruptions, trains can still sneak through.

The above photo shows Laverton station back in 2009 - one of the tracks was ripped up to allow for the upgrade of the station, but V/Line trains to and from Geelong were able to keep on running on the remaining track.
