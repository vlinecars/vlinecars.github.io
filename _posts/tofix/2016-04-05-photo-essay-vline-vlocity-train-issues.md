Since the middle of January 2016 V/Line has been having major issues with their fleet of VLocity trains, resulting in dozens of cancelled services and the crush loading of the trains that are running. Here is a selection of photos from the period.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_7131.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_7131_500.jpg" alt="V/Line's current issues summed up on one photo " /></a>

First some background - two separate issues have been afflicting V/Line's fleet of VLocity trains:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/vline-trains-forced-out-of-service-by-mysterious-wheel-fault-20160114-gm5o4m.html" target="_blank">excessive wheel wear</a> reducing the number of trains available for service.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/metro-bans-vline-trains-from-city-after-train-fails-to-trigger-boom-gates-20160115-gm75uf.html" target="_blank">level crossing activation issues</a> resulting in a ban from the suburban network.</li>
</ul>

The first sign of trouble was the widespread replacement of V/Line services by road coaches, as VLocity trains with worn wheelsets were pulled from service.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4972.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4972_500.jpg" alt="Plenty of Waurn Ponds and Traralgon services replaced by road coaches" /></a>

But things got worse on the evening of January 15, when V/Line blamed "unplanned metro works" for the cancellation of late night Bendigo and Gippsland line services - in reality it was a ban of VLocity trains from the suburban network.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New rumour - <a href="https://twitter.com/metrotrains">@metrotrains</a> have banned <a href="https://twitter.com/VLine">@vline</a> VLocity fleet from their tracks.

By the morning of January 16 V/Line's excuse had changed to "service changes in the suburban area".

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now <a href="https://twitter.com/VLine">@VLine</a> is quoting &quot;service changes in the suburban area&quot; for their trains terminating at Sunbury and Pakenham. <a href="https://t.co/wo6lknOn4s">pic.twitter.com/wo6lknOn4s</a></p>&mdash; Marcus Wong (@aussiewongm) <a href="https://twitter.com/aussiewongm/status/688089590138195968">January 15, 2016</a></blockquote>

At Southern Cross Station passengers for Traralgon and Echuca services were told to catch a suburban train to meet their onward connection.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_3729.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_3729_500.jpg" alt="Traralgon and Echuca trains not running over the metropolitan tracks into Southern Cross - passengers have to catch a suburban train to meet it" /></a>

That night V/Line lashed together a VLocity train between a pair of diesel locomotives, ready to send them across the suburban network to test the failing level crossing outside Dandenong.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4145.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4145_500.jpg" alt="N458 at the other end of a push-pull VLocity transfer at Southern Cross" /></a>

VLocity trains are fitted with a fully automatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scharfenberg_coupler" target="_blank">Scharfenberg coupler</a>, but diesel locomotives only have a semi-automatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janney_coupler" target="_blank">knuckle coupler</a>, so a special 'transition coupler' needs to be fitted to bridge the gap.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4135.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4135_500.jpg" alt="Transition coupler connects the VLocity train Scharfenberg coupler to an N class" /></a>

To allow the tests to take place, Metro Trains obliged by cancelling all late night suburban services between Dandenong and Pakenham.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Suspicious <a href="https://twitter.com/metrotrains">@metrotrains</a> cancellations post midnight, right where <a href="https://twitter.com/VLine">@vline</a> VLocity level crossing issues occurred <a href="https://t.co/dHYrltsRmK">pic.twitter.com/dHYrltsRmK</a></p>&mdash; Marcus Wong (@aussiewongm) <a href="https://twitter.com/aussiewongm/status/688331396037787648">January 16, 2016</a></blockquote>

Once the train arrived at the testing site the diesel locomotives were removed, and the VLocity train made a number of passes over the level crossing.

In the days that followed, more special VLocity transfer trains operated across the suburban network - each movement requiring a diesel locomotive to be attached as a safeguard to activate level crossings along the way.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4708.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4708_500.jpg" alt="N454 trails VL15, 3VL36 and N461 on a push-pull VLocity transfer at Southern Cross" /></a>

By January 18th VLocity trains returned to the Bendigo line - with only two troublesome level crossings on the line at Ginifer and St Albans, safeworking staff were posted at each crossing in order to manually activate the warning devices.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4824.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4824_500.jpg" alt=" Safeworking staff manually activating the level crossing at Furlong Road, St Albans for each train" /></a>

Staff were also posted at the pedestrian crossing to be doubly sure.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4831.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4831_500.jpg" alt="Safeworking staff monitor the pedestrian crossing at Ginifer in case a VLocity train fails to activate it" /></a>

To compensate for the disruptions to services, in V/Line declared free travel on all services from January 23 to 31.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_5055.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_5055_750.jpg" alt="V/Line notice informing passengers of free travel from January 23 to 31" /></a>

To avoid passengers mistaking touching on their myki cards and getting changed for their journey, station staff printed out their 'Free travel - no need to touch on' signs.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_5106.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_5106_750.jpg" alt="Computer printed 'Free travel - no need to touch on' message on a myki reader at Ballarat station" /></a>

At Southern Cross Station the ticket gates were locked open.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_5306.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_5306_500.jpg" alt="Ticket gates open at Southern Cross due to free travel for V/Line passengers" /></a>

As were the emergency entrance gates.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6301.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6301_500.jpg" alt="Free travel for V/Line passengers so the emergency entrances at Southern Cross have been thrown open" /></a>

Yet for some reason, there was still a line of passengers at the Southern Cross Station ticket office.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6303.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6303_500.jpg" alt="Free travel for V/Line passengers, yet there is still a line at the Southern Cross ticket office" /></a>

After the first week of free travel and no resolution in sight, it was extended another week until February 7.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6197.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6197_500.jpg" alt="Free travel for V/Line passengers notice on the myki readers at Southern Cross" /></a>

Official 'no need to touch on or off' flyers were printed and affixed to myki readers across the network.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6198.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6198_500.jpg" alt="Free travel for V/Line passengers notice on the myki readers at Southern Cross" /></a>

Permanent timetable boards were also printed for Southern Cross Station, listing the scheduled V/Line coach replacements in place Monday through Friday.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_7920.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_7920_500.jpg" alt="Sign at Southern Cross Station listing V/Line bus replacements for Monday-Friday" /></a>

Despite the coach replacements and free travel, V/Line commuters were still spilling out of overcrowded trains.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6263.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6263_500.jpg" alt="Passengers spilling out of the doors of their overcrowded VLocity train" /></a>

As an interim fix, a 25 km/h speed restriction was applied to the North Melbourne flyover - supposed source of the excessive wheel wear.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4594.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_4594_500.jpg" alt="25 km/h speed restriction over the North Melbourne flyover" /></a>

On the weekend of February 13 the flyover <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-13/hundreds-of-metres-of-victoria-train-track-replaced/7165642" target="_blank">was shut down to rail traffic</a>, as the 'outside' broad gauge rail through the curves was replaced.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6567.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_6567_500.jpg" alt="Work to replace the 'outside' broad gauge rail on the North Melbourne flyover curves" /></a>

In the weeks that followed, trains continued to use the track, but with rail staff manually applying grease to the rail heads.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_7086.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_7086_500.jpg" alt="Rail lubrication crew slowly make their way along the North Melbourne flyover" /></a>

And the worn wheels beneath VLocity carriages have been replaced with fresh sets.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_9168.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-vlocity-issues-2016/F113_9168_500.jpg" alt="Fresh bogie and wheelsets beneath VLocity carriage 1142" /></a>

From March 21 normal rail services started to return - with <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-08/vline-regional-train-services-to-return-to-normal-in-two-weeks/7230768" target="_blank">43 out of the 64 disrupted services</a> back as trains.

Yet to be completed are fixes for the root cause of each problem: axle counters at level crossings on the Dandenong line to ensure reliable train detection, and an automated rail lubricator on the North Melbourne flyover to reduce wheel wear.
