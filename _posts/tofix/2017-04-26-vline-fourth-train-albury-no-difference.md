For almost a decade V/Line's service to Albury has been a complete and utter joke - marked by three years of full time bus replacements for track upgrades, followed by a revolving door of track and train faults pushing passengers onto buses yet again. The government has promised the public that they are doing something about it, by introducing a fourth train set, but has anything actually changed?

<strong>Some background</strong>

Since the 1960s the railway from Melbourne to Albury consisted of two separate railways - the broad gauge track used by intrastate trains, and a parallel standard gauge track that carried interstate services into New South Wales.

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/srhc-spirit-of-progress-70th-tour/D363_6364_5.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/srhc-spirit-of-progress-70th-tour/D363_6364_5_500.jpg" alt="Parlor Car after turning at Wodonga" /></a>

The problems date back to February 2008, when deteriorating track conditions saw a 80 km/h speed restriction placed on the broad gauge track between Seymour and Albury, forcing V/Line services to terminate at Wangaratta station in order to keep to the timetable.

The 'fix' for the problem was the North-East Rail Revitalisation Project - the broad gauge track between Seymour and Albury would be converted to standard gauge and the existing track upgraded, resulting in a 'brand new' double track railway. Work started in 2008, with V/Line passengers being put onto buses for three years while work was completed.

Just one problem - V/Line only had broad gauge trains!

<a href="http://railgallery.wongm.com/vline-standard-gauge/E105_5521.jpg.html"><img src="http://railgallery.wongm.com/cache/vline-standard-gauge/E105_5521_500.jpg" alt="N453 now on the standard gauge, beside XR555 at the South Dynon SG turntable" /></a>

As a result three V/Line locomotives and 15 passenger carriages were converted to the standard gauge, to create a separate pool of trains to operate the services to Albury. This was enough trains to run three return services per day, with one locomotive and one set of carriages in the workshops under repair.

<strong>Reality bites</strong>

It was soon discovered that a single spare locomotives was not enough to maintain a reliable rail service - so in 2015 the State Government announced that a fourth locomotive would be moved across to the standard gauge fleet to improve reliability.

The Andrews Labor Government is converting an extra V/Line locomotive to standard gauge to improve the reliability of train services on the Albury line.

There are currently only three standard gauge locomotives available to haul trains on the Albury line. Routine maintenance means one of these locomotives is almost always off-line, leaving only two available to operate the six daily services.

If a second locomotive has to be withdrawn from service due to a fault or damage from an animal strike, there is only one available, meaning services need to be replaced by coaches.

Converting a fourth locomotive to standard gauge will give V/Line the buffer they need to provide more reliable services to Albury line passengers.

The transfer of an additional locomotive from the broad gauge fleet has been made possible by the introduction of a new overnight maintenance regime, which means more trains are available for passenger services.

The improvement to Albury services comes as the Labor Government prepares to launch its Regional Network Development Plan – a long-term strategy to boost capacity, reliability and coverage of the regional public transport network.

Communities in Northern Victoria will be consulted as part of the development of the plan, with consultation to kick off next month.

The additional locomotive is expected to be ready for service on the Albury line by the end of July this year.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Public Transport, Jacinta Allan

“Right now the Albury line is running on the bare minimum of trains. Adding a fourth locomotive will provide the capacity V/Line needs to improve services and make them more reliable.”

“Our Regional Network Development Plan offers an opportunity to further improve services to Albury, and I encourage people to put forward their views during consultation over the coming months.”

Quote attributable to Member for Northern Victoria, Jaclyn Symes

“This is a great announcement for Albury line passengers and I look forward to working with local communities across northern Victoria on a long-term plan for better public transport through the Regional Network Development Plan.”</blockquote>

Unfortunately for the people of North East Victoria, a spare locomotive wasn't enough to improve their V/Line service, so in 2016 the government decided to shuffle the deck chairs - reconfiguring the existing fleet of three 5-carriage long trains into four 4-carriage long trains.

The Andrews Labor Government is building a fourth train for the Albury line, to boost the reliability of services while it plans for the next generation of rolling stock for passengers in Victoria’s north east.

Minister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan joined Member for Northern Victoria Jaclyn Symes at the Downer Rail workshop in Melbourne today, where V/Line has started reconfiguring existing carriages to create a fourth train.

Currently, three five-carriage trains operate on the Albury line. This is the minimum required to run the three return services to Albury each day and means that if a train has to be pulled out of service, the only option is to put passengers on coaches.

The extra train will mean there is one in reserve if anything unexpected happens – boosting reliability for passengers.

On average there are around 330 seats per train and currently an average of 200 seats available on Albury-line services, so the reduction of carriages on each train will not affect the ability of passengers to get a seat.

The reconfiguration work currently underway will take a carriage off each of the three existing trains and add a new one to create four four-carriage trains.

V/Line has also already sourced and begun refurbishing a power van for the fourth train, which acts like a power supply generator for the fourth train, so it can have lighting, heating and cooling.

The significant upgrade is part of $15 million provided by the Labor Government in the Victorian Budget 2016-17.

The investment will also clean and repair the interior of the existing carriages, to make them more comfortable for passengers, and fund planning for the next generation of trains for the north east line.

The reconfigured trains will start service in the first half of 2017.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Public Transport Jacinta Allan

“We’re building a fourth train for the Albury line to boost reliability and it’s great to see work underway.”

“Reconfiguring the carriages will improve services for local passengers while we plan for next generation trains for the north east line.”

Quotes attributable to Member for Northern Victoria Jaclyn Symes

“I am looking forward to the introduction of the extra train to the North-East line that will deliver much needed improvements to the service and comfort for commuters.”

“We’ve sourced the power van, work has started on the carriage refurbishment, and next year the new train will be in service – we’re getting it done.”</blockquote>

This fourth train <a href="http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/fourth-train-for-north-east-line-now-taking-passengers/" target="_blank">entered service in April 2017</a>, complete with flashy new PTV branding.

But has anything really changed?

Or is it just Malibu Stacy, with the same problems as before, but with a new hat?

<strong>Footnote</strong>

A few weeks after entering service, the brand new train <a href="http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/4613311/spray-pain-for-train-carriages/" target="_blank">was attacked by graffiti vandals</a>.

<blockquote>Reconditioned V/Line trains have been targeted in a graffiti attack. 

Services between Albury and Melbourne continued to run this week despite the carriages being vandalised with green, yellow, orange and black spray paint. 

The 12.05pm Melbourne to Albury service was replaced by buses, and the 5.20pm Albury to Melbourne was also replaced by coaches on Friday, but a V/Line spokeswoman said that was not due to the graffiti. 

The carriages will be taken out of service to be washed next week.</blockquote>

Wasn't the point of creating a fourth train to allow for Albury services to keep running, even if another train is already in the workshops?

<strong>January 2018 update</strong>

Even with four locomotives V/Line <a href="http://www.bordermail.com.au/story/5145656/north-east-railway-line-has-a-christmas-new-year-shocker/?cs=11" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still can't provide a rail service</a> to Albury.

<blockquote>V/Line confirmed 30 train services have been replaced by buses since Boxing Day.

“V/Line would like to apologise to Albury line passengers for the disruption to services over the past week,” a V/Line spokesperson said.

“All four locomotives that run on the Albury line have experienced unforeseen faults.

“Engineers are working as quickly as possible to repair the trains and we thank passengers for their patience while we work to return train services to normal.”

Two train services on Tuesday have already been cancelled and replaced by buses due to “maintenance requirements”.</blockquote>
