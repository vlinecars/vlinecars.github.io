V/Line 'no entry through conductors door' flyer

Last week I noticed flyers distributed through a loco hauled set, stating...

    "Travelling safely on our loco services"
    "No entering the train through the conductors van"
    "From 14 September 2009 the door to the conductors van will be locks prior to departure and passengers must enter the train through the assigned carriage doors."



I assume this means the risk assessments mean conductors are no longer allowed outside the train at all when it is motion (they used to hang out of the ACN/BCH door until the platform was clear). I guess this will kill off any late running passengers jumping onto trains as they pull out of Southern Cross.

It will also prevent passengers boarding trains departing Southern Cross after they have initially departed the platform, but before the train gets the stick to actually depart off the north end of the platform. My evening train home departs from platform 7A, but without fail it gets held for at least 30 seconds on platform 7B waiting for the stick out onto the main line. The external emergency door release is not because you are smeg with V/Line holding your train!

On the subject of doors, I have also noticed some connies trigger the closing of the power-assisted doors on the N sets a few minutes before departure, then release them again for any further passengers to reopen them. It isn't a bad idea - the power-assisted doors are fault ridden hunks of crap, and by testing their closure before departure the connie can run down and check up on them, as opposed to finding out at departure time, and delaying the train. Of course, if V/Line fitted power-assisted doors that are not fault ridden hunks of crap, then the conductors would not need his work-around. 








I hear that V/line decided to change the rules for  V/Line conductors on commuter services,  apparently they aren't allowed to walk through the train anymore (since Monday).










The rules actually relate specifically to H set carriages and state that conductors can no longer walk through the gangway as it is a dangerous area at any speed. This means that conductors can no longer walk from one end of the train to the other between stations. Conductors can check one carriage, then wait in that carriage until the next station and platform, the use the normal external doors to exit and enter the next carriage. Though this means for the period between stations, the conductor will have to sit in the carriage with the passengers.
I dont think you will find many conductors who will be willing to do that.
There is also the issue of anouncements being required, and currently they can only be done from the BCH car.
H sets are primarily used on Sunbury and Bacchus March runs, but make appearances on Geelong, Seymour and the odd Traralgon run.

The new rules are primarily for the conductors safety, which i am all for.
If passengers are concerned of safety levels and the other bollocks that was listed on http://www.busaustralia.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=45552, they need to make formal complaints to V/Lines feedback.

Then and only then alternative rostering of carriages may occur, though with current fleet levels not much can be done until more V/Locity sets are deployed.
