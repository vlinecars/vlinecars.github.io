It was the last day that trains would be running on the Geelong line for a few weeks, as there will be work done to install new signals.

I was also the last day S302 was supposed to run.

It is a locomotive in case you are wondering…

First I went up to Melbourne to meet some other railfans, before catching the 12:40 train to Warrnambool. We got into Geelong around an hour later.

We left the train, and went for lunch. Two of the other guys stayed on the train to Marshall, and got to ride up front in the cab.

The Warrnambool train arrived back in Melbourne at 9:09pm – it was actually 1 minute early for a change.

And that’s the end. Or it is supposed to be. Who knows…
