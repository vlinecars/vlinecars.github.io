From Newsrail June 1984:



All steelbodied country passenger rollingstock are to be numbered as a single series so that individual numbers allocated to each vehicle are permanently retained irrespective of subsequent modification or reclassifications. The proposed number series are as follows:
N cars and proposed intercity cars: 1-100 (unchanged) [wongm: proposed intercity cars = proposed R cars?]
H cars and Tulloch trailers: 101-200 [wongm: Tulloch = MTH cars]
S and Z cars, sleeping and special cars: 201-300
D (formerly VBPY) vans: 301-400 (as per previous direction)

It is not envisaged that any alteration be made to the numbering of wooden bodies cars having regard to the short remaining life of these vehicles or to joint stock cars used on interstate services.

Set numbers:
Car sets 1-19 are N sets
Car sets 21-35 are H sets (the number space has room for sets numbered up to 40, not all sets exist today, some where broken up and cars put into other sets)
Car sets in the 50-60s were 1980s/1990s era Z sets, given by ACZ in consist

Carriage numbers:
From these, there are a few groupings to be gleaned.
1-100 = original N cars
251-263 = original AZ cars, with lots of small side windows
264-276 = original BZ cars, with fewer but bigger side windows
Low 200s are BS cars.

N cars were roughly built in numerical order. BRN cars were a later development, hence they are higher up in the number space. The original sets appeared as ACN-BN-BN.

With some maths you can draw relationships between the two:
- Divide ACN number by 3 to get the set number and vice versa.
- Add 200 to the old Z set numbers for the ACZ number and vice versa.
- Subtract 100 from a BCH code for the original H set it appeared in
- Subtract 140 from a BH code for the original H set it appeared in
- Subtract 160 from a BTH code for the original H set it appeared in
- Subtract 180 from a BIH code for the original H set it appeared in

The gaps were just to allow the types of cars to start with round numbers:

N cars at 1
H cars at 101
S cars at 201
Z cars at 241
