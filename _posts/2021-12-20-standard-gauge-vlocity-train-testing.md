September 2021 saw the commencement of mainline testing of the brand new standard gauge VLocity trains which will soon be deployed to the V/Line Albury service.

<strong>Initial testing</strong>

The first set to be delivered was VS93, delivered on broad gauge from Bombardier Dandenong to South Dynon in August 2021. Following gauge conversion and test runs around the workshop, on 23 September 2021 VS93 departed South Dynon for Seymour to commence the mainline testing program.

The new VLocity trains appear much the same as sets VL80+ with [the upgraded cab design](https://www.vlinecars.com/2020/10/new-vlocity-train-cab-design.html).

Bogies virtually identical as well.

The main spotting feature being the blanked off wall for the buffet module onboard the centre carriage. During initial testing, this extra grill lacked a permanent covering.

The buffet carriage was delivered as carriage 1393, but by 19 November 2021 it had been renumbered 1593 - placing it into a seprate number group.

The train returned to South Dynon a number of times during the test program, before returning again to Seymour, with the first VLocity train visiting Albury on 29 October 2021.

<strong>Crew familiarisation</strong>

On 22 November 2021 VS93 was sent to Southern Cross Station platform 2 for crew familiarisation training, a process repeated for a number of weeks.

<strong>Final testing</strong>

Following these tests, revenues services should be not far away.
