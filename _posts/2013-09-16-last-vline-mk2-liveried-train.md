Yesterday, Sunday 15th September, the last ever full V/Line Passenger MkII red and blue liveried train was run, consisting of N465+N18 (ACN54-BRN52-BN1).

<small>N465 leads a down Bairnsdale service across the viaduct towards Flinders Street Station (October 30, 2013)</small>

It ran 8403 (0804 Southern Cross to Traralgon) on the down, and 8432 (1803 Traralgon to Southern Cross) on the up, stabling during the day in 'C' siding at Traralgon.

N18, the last red and blue carriage set, was transferred by N471 to Newport Workshops today (16/09/2013) for repaint and refurbishment.

Interestingly, car BZN267 and set N12 have already been painted in the current V/Line livery twice before N18 got its chance! BZN267 was outshopped a month or so ago, and N12 was outshopped last Friday, 12/9.
