The implementation of new digital radio systems to
replace V/Line’s existing obsolete Non-Urban Train Radio
system, neared completion during 2015-16 – well ahead
of the original planned 2018 project completion date.
Most V/Line trains were fitted with the new digital
radio systems, and completion is expected to be as
early as 2017.
Deployment of train controller capabilities were
advanced to testing and acceptance of network
infrastructure was underway. The installation onto
the majority of the train passenger fleet was almost
finished, and all 59 VLocity trains had been completed.
Sprinter locomotives and high rail maintenance
vehicle deployment were also planned.
The aged non-urban train radio (NUTR) system has
continued to be turned off in stages, as regional rail
communications network (RRCN) capability replaced old
systems on trains and infrastructure in regional areas.
The 2016-17 State Budget included a further $8.638m
to deliver the upgrade of the NUTR.

TRAIN / TRACK MACHINE COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT
All locomotives operating as lead units on running lines within the Network must be fitted with approved Communications
Equipment.
The equipment on Locomotives will comprise of the following:
• End to End Local Radio
• Train to Base Radio
OR
• ICE radio, either RRCN or NTCS capable
ICE = IN CAB EQUIPMENT – defined by the ARTC NTCS service (for Standard Gauge) or defined by the V/Line RRCN service
(for Broad Gauge). This is the replacement of the NUTR train to base equipment.

Significant progress was made on the Regional Rail
Communications Network (RRCN) to update our asset
communications systems to a 3G service with satellite
backup. The RRCN will replace the non-urban train radio
(NUTR) and be completed in 2017

All Sprinters have now been fitted for ICE radio and the
NUTR based train radio system has now been permanently
switched off. Minor troubles with interference during
transmissions via the UHF is being addressed

Upgrading Regional Rail
Communications
Major milestones achieved in the Regional Rail
Communications Network (RRCN) this year have pushed
the project forward, with the majority of the work expected
to be completed as early as 2016 – well ahead of the
original 2018 completion date.
The $65 million project is replacing V/Line’s existing
obsolete Non-Urban Train Radio (NUTR) system, with a
modern digital system, to enable better network control
and improved reliability. Deployment of train controller
capabilities was advanced to near completion during the
year and installation onto 25 per cent of the train fleet
was completed. The aged NUTR system has continued
to be turned off in stages, as RRCN capability replaced
old systems on trains in regional areas.





2014 is going to be a busy year for the Radio Test
Party. Along with our normal annual NUTR and RFR
testing throughout the V/Line system we also have to
test the new RRCN (Regional Rail Communications
Network) - or ICE as most of us drivers know it as.

ICE
Our new communications system will operate off
Telstra’s 3G Digital Mobile Phone System. Our old
NUTR system have base stations strategically placed
along the corridors that receive our Train to Base radio
calls and then send them by landline to Centrol in
Melbourne. The ICE radio unit has 3G as well as two
UHF radios and a Satellite phone built into it. You make
Centrol calls or other operational phone calls through
the 3G side. If the 3G system is down or in an area with
no signal, the calls will default through to the Satellite
system. The UHF radio is also built into the system,
unlike now where we have a separate NUTR and UHF
radio. Hopefully this will un-clutter our cabs a little.
Lionel Britton and I took locomotive P13 on a run to
Albury on Feb 25th and 26th, to test the ICE radio. This
locomotive is our only piece of rolling stock to have
been as of yet fitted out with a functioning ICE . We had
a radio engineer from a company called 4Tel from
Sydney accompany us on this run. We were limited on
how many Control calls we could place to Junee
Control, due to controls workload, instead we placed 3G
and Satellite phone calls to different people and other
trains as we proceeded to Albury and back. All calls
worked well and were so much clearer than current
Satellite signal for
the whole of the trip
and at all times we
had a clear signal.
This was also
happened when we
proceeded the
length of the
Brumby Street
T u n n e l a t
Footscray. None of
our Control or
p h o n e c a l l s
dropped out along
the trip. One call we
made went for 15
kilometres and did
not drop out or
break up. The
Geofencing on the
ICE worked well,
automatically changing from Adelaide control to Junee
on the down and vice versa on the up at Somerton Loop.
Issues we have found so far with the ICE system are
mainly things that can be fixed with software changes
and updates. The Directories in the unit are mainly made
up for trains that operate over the other side of the border
on the ARTC system. In the Operations listings in the
phone directory, for example, we have numbers for the
Kalgoorlie signal box and the Broadmeadows in
Newcastle signal box. I doubt if any V/Line train will ever
go that far afield, so we have asked to remove any of the
numbers not suitable to our running . This is so we don’t
have to scroll through all of Australia’s signal boxes just
to place a call to Seymour signaller. We will need to
check all the Victorian numbers listed to make sure they
are right. When we tried the Newport box number we got
the Newport shunters and Sunshine’s boxes number was
greeted with a Telstra disconnected recording. The UHF
directory will be cleaned up with the removal of blank
channels and channels not used by Vline. Another issue
found was with the keypad. While placing the T.D.
number into the unit, we have discovered that like an old
style mobile phone, you have to key through T, U and V
before you get to 8 and so on with the other digits. This
will mean a lot of key pushing just to enter 8606. The ICE
unit, again, is set up for ARTC interstate running, where
T.D. numbers are mix of letter and numbers. For example
the XPT on the up to Melbourne would be ST23 and a
freight train could be 5MB5. It’s only a small thing but will
save time and mistakes within our Victorian environment,
to have numbers before letters come up when a key is
pushed. This can and will be fixed with a software
change.
Last major issue is that we have two live UHF radios in
our cabs with the ICE unit. A Driver can program each
radio with any UHF channel they like. To make a channel
available to transmit on the driver need only push F3 or
F4 button to what corresponds with what the driver has
programmed. This makes life easier to scroll back and
forth with whatever channels the driver might need.
Problem is that even though you can only transmit on the
one channel that is selected, you can hear chatter from
both units at once. Having two UHF channels chatting
away at the same time could lead to some confusion. If a
driver is receiving a caution order over the safe working
channel, the last thing he needs is an LTR transmission
taking his concentration away from the task at hand. We
are asking for the non-live channel to be muted til the
driver selects it by pressing either the F3 or F4 button.
Sometime in the next month or so, the Radio Test Party
will be wheeling out A66 from Sth Dynon to start ICE
radio testing on the broad gauge. Unlike testing on the
standard gauge, we will be able to make a lot more tests
to train control. Hopefully, like NUTR testing, a
technician will be provided at Centrol to take our calls,
leaving the controller himself in peace.
All up I think the new radio system will be a step forward
compared to the system we have now, though it will take
a little bit of getting used to. Many Pacific National and
Country Link drivers we have spoken to have said that
they liked the ICE system, but it is a steep learning curve
before you can operate it proffesionally and to its full
potential.
HANDHELD RADIOS
Lionel Britton and I have been trialling four new handheld
radios. Two were from Motorola and two from a company
called Tait. The need for a new handheld has been
brought about by the soon to be life expiry of the old
Motorola MTX838s. These old Motorola’s are not
compatible in the Off Train Radio mode with the new ICE
units. The newer Motorola GP339s are not manufactured
any more, so a new handheld has to be sourced. Out of
the 4 radios we have chosen the Tait TP8100 . All radios
had good battery life, approx 3 working shifts between
charges. They were also lighter and easier to handle then
the MTX8388. In the end it came down to screens. Of all
the radios the Tait P8100, which we have chosen, had
the smaller screen but had the larger font making it
easier out of all of them to read. It was also the smallest
and lightest of the lot. Apparently this unit is used by
some of the CFA brigades.
