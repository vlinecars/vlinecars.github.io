This is is the first set undergoing refurbishment as part of the $13m rollingstock upgrade program - and is in a new V/Line livery, which comprises predominantly of shades of grey, with white doors and red and purple trim lines. </p>
<p>Internally the set has also been refurbished - the changes including</p>
<ul>

<li>New seat covers</li>
<li>New carpet</li>
<li>New marine type toilets</li>
<li>New &lsquo;VLocity style&rsquo; vanities</li>

<li>Seating layout same as previous however the seats opposite the toilet in the BCH carriage are now of the fold up/down type, to enable wheelchair passengers to sit in their chairs away from the doors.</li>
<li>Handrails around the doors are now painted yellow for visibility</li>
<li>All existing decals inside carriages are replaced with new ones &ndash; purple ones for internal fittings and seat numbers and red ones for the doors.</li>
</ul>
