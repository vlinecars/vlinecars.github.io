<p>On Tuesday 4th September 2007, N474 ran light engine from Southern Cross to Newport Workshops to collect recently repainted and internally refurbished H set FSH25, for a test run to Geelong and back. This is is the first set undergoing refurbishment as part of the $13m rollingstock upgrade program - and is in a new V/Line livery, which comprises predominantly of shades of grey, with white doors and red and purple trim lines. </p>
<p>Internally the set has also been refurbished - the changes including</p>
<ul>
<li>New BCH conductors van door locking system to prevent unauthorised passenger access &ndash; door can&rsquo;t be opened from within the passenger saloon without a 6P key. (Same locking as that fitted to ACN conductors vans in Power Assisted Door N sets)</li>
<li>New seat covers</li>
<li>
<p>New carpet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New marine type toilets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New &lsquo;VLocity style&rsquo; vanities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New curtains</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seating layout same as previous however the seats opposite the toilet in the BCH carriage are now of the fold up/down type, to enable wheelchair passengers to sit in their chairs away from the doors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Handrails around the doors are now painted yellow for visibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All existing decals inside carriages are replaced with new ones &ndash; purple ones for internal fittings and seat numbers and red ones for the doors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
