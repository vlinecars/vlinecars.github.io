Dudley Street Shunters Float

When I was waiting for Avoca and friends to come past, I noticed something new about the shunters float in use at Dudley Street. (It gets used between a carirage set and the loco when taking carriages through the car wash)

There appears to be controls for the power door system on the side of the wagon.

There is a switch labeled 'power on / off' as well as push buttons 'door close' and 'door open'. The box is then wired to a jumper cable at each end of the wagon. The cable appears to be the same type as a loco MU cale, that is also used on the H cars for door control between sets.

So I'm guessing this gizmo was designed so that the shunters can make sure the H set doors are closed before they go for a wash, rather than walking along and closing them manually? Confused

From my experience the power doors on the refitted N sets close automatically when both the head end power, batteries (?) and generators fail, and this wagon doesn't have the righ connections for those sets anyway. 



     

It's a strange jumper - they used a Wilco probably to save money, but now it has a non standard jumper. They should have gone with a standard loco MU socket so they could use a standard jumper instead.


The wagon VZLA 76 ?? was modified to operate with "H" type cars to operate the doors in the closed position via the Y class MU receptacle.


Am I correct in saying that the doors are air operated off the train line. Eg: each door has a pneumatic cylinder attached, when power is connected to the set and the controls set to 'door close' air is routed into it to keep the door closed, and when the 'door open' is used the cylinder is vented, allowing the door to flop open? It appears when power is lost the cylinder gets vented as well. Confused

I was wondering how the gizmo worked without power - leeching off the MU cables seems logical. With no HEP or onboard generators, batteries would be the only other option.

Power door N sets have a big square blue plug between carriages, older sets (and Z / S carriages) have a 3 pin plug for the PA system. This is in addition to the HEP plug, and the air lines.

[EDIT] V/Line has a second shunters float that is in use at the Geelong carriage wash - it's a 60ft ex-SFX (?) flat wagon. V/Line doesn't stable H sets at Geelong overnight, so I don't see a reason for that wagon to receive the door equipment. 





I'm going to run with wongm's train of thought &  going to make a huge assumption & state that the 74 volts from the locomotive is used to supply the control voltage to the box, then the control is passed onto the car set through the control cable (the bigger "railway" connector goes to the carset, the "Wilco" brand connector stays with the shunters' flat being an oddball connector)
