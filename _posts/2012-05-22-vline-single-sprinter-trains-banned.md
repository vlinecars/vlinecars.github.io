Since March 2012 the solo operation of V/Line Sprinter railcars has been banned from the V/Line network. 

The initial ban was introduced on 26 March following a track circuit detection failure, and included the complete rail network, but by May 2012 it was loosened so that a single Sprinter DMU consist is allowed to operate in station limits, on local yard moves, and on the Stony Point line.

**Before the ban**
